<p>A high-level Parallel I/O Library for structured grid applications</p>

<h2>
<a id="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>PIO can use NetCDF (version 4.3.3+) and/or PnetCDF (version 1.6.0+) for I/O.
Ideally, the NetCDF version should be built with MPI, which requires that it
be linked with an MPI-enabled version of HDF5.  Optionally, NetCDF can be 
built with DAP support, which introduces a dependency on CURL.  Additionally,
HDF5, itself, introduces dependencies on LIBZ and (optionally) SZIP.</p>

<h2>
<a id="configuring-with-cmake" class="anchor" href="#configuring-with-cmake" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuring with CMake</h2>

<p>To configure the build, PIO requires CMake version 2.8.12+.  The typical
configuration with CMake can be done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake [-DOPTION1=value1 -DOPTION2=value2 ...] /path/to/pio/source
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>mpicc</code> and <code>mpif90</code> are the appropriate MPI-enabled compiler wrappers
for your system.</p>

<p>The <code>OPTIONS</code> section typically should consist of pointers to the install
locations for various dependencies, assuming these dependencies are not 
located in <em>canonical</em> search locations.  </p>

<p>For each dependency <code>XXX</code>, one can specify the location of its 
installation path with the CMake variable <code>XXX_PATH</code>.  If the <code>C</code> and
<code>Fortran</code> libraries for the dependency are installed in different locations
(such as can be done with NetCDF), then you can specify individually
<code>XXX_C_PATH</code> and <code>XXX_Fortran_PATH</code>.  Hence, you can specify the locations
of both NetCDF-C and NetCDF-Fortran, as well as PnetCDF, with the following
CMake configuration line:</p>

<pre><code>CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake -DNetCDF_C_PATH=/path/to/netcdf-c \
                         -DNetCDF_Fortran_PATH=/path/to/netcdf-fortran \
                         -DPnetCDF_PATH=/path/to/pnetcdf \
                         /path/to/pio/source
</code></pre>

<p>This works for the dependencies: <code>NetCDF</code>, <code>PnetCDF</code>, <code>HDF5</code>, <code>LIBZ</code>, <code>SZIP</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="additional-cmake-options" class="anchor" href="#additional-cmake-options" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional CMake Options</h3>

<p>Additional configuration options can be specified on the command line.</p>

<p>The <code>PIO_ENABLE_TIMING</code> option can be set to <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code> to enable or
disable the use of GPTL timing in the PIO libraries.  This feature requires
the GPTL C library for the PIO <code>C</code> library and the GPTL Fortran library with
the <code>perf_mod.mod</code> and <code>perf_utils.mod</code> interface modules.  If these GPTL
libraries are already installed on the system, the user can point PIO to the
location of these libraries with the <code>GPTL_PATH</code> variable (or, individually,
<code>GPTL_C_PATH</code> and <code>GPTL_Fortran_Perf_PATH</code> variables).  However, if these
GPTL libraries are not installed on the system, and GPTL cannot be found,
then PIO will build its own internal version of GPTL.  </p>

<p>If PnetCDF is not installed on the system, the user can disable its use by
setting <code>-DWITH_PNETCDF=OFF</code>.  This will disable the search for PnetCDF on the
system and disable the use of PnetCDF from within PIO.</p>

<p>If the user wishes to disable the PIO tests, then the user can set the
variable <code>-DPIO_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF</code>.  This will entirely disable the CTest 
testing suite, as well as remove all of the test build targets.</p>

<p>If you wish to install PIO in a safe location for use later with other
software, you may set the <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> variable to point to the
desired install location.</p>

<h2>
<a id="building" class="anchor" href="#building" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building</h2>

<p>Once you have successfully configured PIO with CMake in a build directory.
From within the build directory, build PIO with:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>This will build the <code>pioc</code> and <code>piof</code> libraries.</p>

<h2>
<a id="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p>If you desire to do testing, and <code>PIO_ENABLE_TESTS=ON</code> (which is the default
setting), you may build the test executables with:</p>

<pre><code>make tests
</code></pre>

<p>Once the tests have been built, you may run tests with:</p>

<pre><code>ctest
</code></pre>

<p>If you have not run <code>make tests</code> before you run <code>ctest</code>, then you will see
all of the tests fail.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may build the test executables and then run tests 
immediately with:</p>

<pre><code>make check
</code></pre>

<p>(similar to the typical <code>make check</code> Autotools target).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is important to note that these tests are designed to run in parallel.
If you are on one of the supported supercomputing platforms (i.e., NERSC, NWSC, ALCF, 
etc.), then the <code>ctest</code> command will assume that the tests will be run in an appropriately
configured and scheduled parallel job.  This can be done by requesting an interactive
session from the login nodes and then running <code>ctest</code> from within the interactive
terminal.  Alternatively, this can be done by running the <code>ctest</code> command from a
job submission script.  It is important to understand, however, that <code>ctest</code> itself
will preface all of the test executable commands with the appropriate <code>mpirun</code>/<code>mpiexec</code>/<code>runjob</code>/etc.
Hence, you should not further preface the <code>ctest</code> command with these MPI launchers.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installing" class="anchor" href="#installing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing</h2>

<p>Once you have built the PIO libraries, you may install them in the location
specified by the <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>.  To do this, simply type:</p>

<pre><code>make install
</code></pre>

<p>If the internal GPTL libraries were built (because GPTL could not be found
and the <code>PIO_ENABLE_TIMING</code> variable is set to <code>ON</code>), then these libraries
will be installed with PIO.</p>
